    <h1>Learn Git - A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

    Â <p>This guide will walk you through the process of learning Git, from installation to committing your changes.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Installation:** Download and install Git for your operating system. You can find official installers on
            the Git SCM website: https://git-scm.com/downloads</li>
        <li>**Basic Configuration:** Open a terminal window and run the following commands to set your username and
            email address (replace with your details):<br>
            ```bash
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            git config --global user.email "[email address removed]"
            ```
        </li>
        <li>**Creating a Repository:** Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and initialize a new Git
            repository using the command:<br>
            ```bash
            git init
            ```
            This creates a hidden folder called ".git" which stores all Git-related information.
        </li>
        <li>**Adding Files:** Use the `git add` command followed by the filename(s) to stage them for version control.
            Example:<br>
            ```bash
            git add index.html styles.css
            ```
            You can also use wildcards like `git add *` to add all untracked files in the current directory.
        </li>
        <li>**Committing Changes:** Once you've added files, create a snapshot of the current state with a commit
            message using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`. The message describes the changes you made.
        </li>
        <li>**Understanding the Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository:** These are key Git concepts. The
            working directory is where your project files reside. The staging area holds files prepared for the next
            commit. The repository stores all historical versions of your project.
        </li>
        <li>**Exploring Git Commands:** Learn essential commands like `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git
            checkout`, and `git branch` to manage your repository, view commit history, compare changes, and work on
            different versions (branches).
        </li>
        <li>**Remote Repositories (Optional):** Connect your local repository to a remote hosting service like GitHub or
            GitLab. This allows collaboration and version control across teams. There are additional steps involved for
            setting this up.
        </li>
        <li>**Practice and Learn More:** The best way to learn Git is by practicing! Start with small projects and
            gradually explore advanced features. Resources like the official Git documentation and interactive tutorials
            can be helpful: https://git-scm.com/doc</li>
